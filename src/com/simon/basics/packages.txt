Package is a folder that allow you to structure a program.
packages are used to group related classes.
packages are divided into two categories:
    - Build-in packages (from Java API)
    - User defined packages (created by the user)

TO use a class or package from the JAVA API library we use the `import`
keyword:
    import package.name.class
    import package.name.*
